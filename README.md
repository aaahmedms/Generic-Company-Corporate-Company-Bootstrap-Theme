# Generic-Company Corporate Company Bootstrap Theme
Generic Company is a modular SPA style theme that is arranged in a vertical list format using a series of organized web element components. The theme can be customized and organized however the user wishes by simply taking out a section of the webpage, and then placing it somewhere else within the body of the html file. The webpage also scales on mobile devices, and is supported on multiple resolutions.
